## About Project(2-3 lines)
Futaba is a DEX that allows cross-chain swaps with only one transaction & source chain gas cost. 
Users select the coins they want to exchange and get the target currency without having to spend multiple Defi.
Provides an easier, faster, and more user-friendly experience.

## the problem it is solving
The problem of slow transaction speed and slow time to get the target currency.
The problem is that the current cross-chain DEX is not a complete one-transaction and source chain gas fee payment.
The problem is that there are many DeFi's out there and it is hard to know which one to use.
